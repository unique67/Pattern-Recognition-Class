# Pattern-Recognition-Class

Pattern recognition is a course that focuses on the analysis and application of classical and state of the art
machine learning algorithms. The first half of the course tackles fundamentals such as representation of
data and the three general approaches to pattern recognition namely supervised, semi-supervised and
unsupervised learning. In conjunction, students will also understand the use of tools and technologies to
solve machine learning problems. Classical algorithms from simple regressions to statistical models will be
discussed and in the second half, the discussion will then move to more advanced deep learning methods
such as neural network based architectures and models. Students will tackle various usecases in order to
apply the concepts discussed in class. The final output will be a research paper that attempts to solve a
problem using machine learning methods in comparison with existing ones. Students are expected to
perform analytical input to empirical results for ideally publishable material by the end of the course.
